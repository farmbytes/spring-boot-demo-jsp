# spring-boot-demo-jsp

### Sample project that shows how to use JSP in a spring-boot project. 

1. Create JSPs in a web-relative location folder (ex: /WEB-INF/views)

2. Set up spring.mvc.view.prefix and spring.mvc.view.suffix in application.properties file. Alternatively, we can set up a view resolver instead of setting the properties in application.properties file. Refer to SpringBootDemoConfiguration.java on how the ViewResolver has been configured.
